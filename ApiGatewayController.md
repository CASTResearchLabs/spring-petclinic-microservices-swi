
### Proposed Testing Plan for `ApiGatewayController` Changes

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for the `addVisitsToOwners` method to ensure it correctly handles a list of owners and applies visits to each owner's pets.

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the interactions between the `ApiGatewayController` and the data entities (`pets`, `types`, `visits`, `owners`) to ensure data integrity is maintained.

3. **User Transaction/API Endpoint Tests**:
   - **owner-details.template.html**:
     - Test the frontend to ensure it correctly displays and manages a list of owners.
   - **index.html**:
     - Ensure that the main page correctly interacts with the updated API endpoints and displays owner information as expected.

4. **Data Integrity Tests**:
   - Verify that the data integrity is maintained when handling multiple owners and their associated visits.
