Thoughts for https://github.com/CASTResearchLabs/spring-petclinic-microservices-swi/commit/3b9895d1b88ed3e9310b18513a590140268b6b70

"To begin addressing the task, we need to locate the `ApiGatewayController.java` file where the `addVisitsToOwner` method is defined. This will allow us to update the method to handle a list of owners instead of a single owner. Let's start by searching for the `ApiGatewayController.java` file in the repository.\n\nI'll use the `find_file` function to locate the `ApiGatewayController.java` file.",
"The `ApiGatewayController.java` file is located in the `spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/api/boundary/web/` directory. Let's open this file to review and update the `addVisitsToOwner` method.",
"The `addVisitsToOwner` method is currently designed to handle a single `OwnerDetails` object. We need to modify this method to handle a list of `OwnerDetails` instead. This involves changing the method signature and updating the logic to iterate over a list of owners.\n\nLet's proceed with updating the `addVisitsToOwner` method to handle a list of owners.",
"The method signature has been updated to handle a list of `OwnerDetails`. Now, we need to adjust the logic inside the method to iterate over the list of owners and apply the visits to each owner's pets.\n\nLet's proceed with updating the logic inside the `addVisitsToOwners` method.",
"The logic inside the `addVisitsToOwners` method has been successfully updated to iterate over a list of owners and apply the visits to each owner's pets. Now, we need to check for any incoming dependencies for this method and update them if necessary.\n\nLet's search for any references to the `addVisitsToOwner` method in the repository to identify any dependencies that might need updating.",
"The only references to the `addVisitsToOwner` method are within the `ApiGatewayController.java` file itself. This means there are no external dependencies that need updating due to our changes.\n\nSince there are no additional dependencies to update, we can proceed to submit the changes.",
