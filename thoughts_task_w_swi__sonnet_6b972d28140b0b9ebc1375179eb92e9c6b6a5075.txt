"Let me analyze the task. We need to update the `addVisitsToOwner` method in `ApiGatewayController.java` to handle a new parameter indicating if a visit was paid for. First, let's locate this file.",
"Great, I found the file. Let's open it to examine the current implementation of the `addVisitsToOwner` method.",
"I see the `addVisitsToOwner` method. Before modifying it, let's check its internal dependencies using the `.intra` file to understand any internal program flow dependencies.",
"Let's check for incoming dependencies using the `.inward` file.",
"Now let's check the testing dependencies using the `.testing` file.",
"Let me reopen the ApiGatewayController.java file to get the correct context and indentation.",
"Now I'll update the `addVisitsToOwner` method to handle the paid parameter. The method needs to filter visits based on whether they were paid for. I'll modify the code using the edit command.",
"Now I need to update the call to `addVisitsToOwner` in the `getOwnerDetails` method to include the new parameter. Let me make that change.",
"Now I need to add a new endpoint that allows filtering for paid visits. I'll add this new endpoint.",
"I need to fix a bug in the `getOwnerDetailsInternal` method where we're not passing the `showPaidOnly` parameter correctly to `addVisitsToOwner`.",
"Now I need to check if the Visit class has the `isPaid` method. Let me search for the Visit class.",
"Let me open the Visit class to check if it has the isPaid method and add it if it doesn't.",
"I need to add the `paid` field to the Visit class. Let me add it.",
"Now I need to check if there are any incoming dependencies for the Visit class that need to be updated.",
"Let me check the internal dependencies for the Visit class.",
"Let me check the testing dependencies for the Visit class.",
"Now I need to update the database schema to include the new paid column. Let me search for the schema file.",
"Let me open the visits service schema file to add the new column.",
"Let me update the schema to include the paid column.",
"Let me also update the MySQL schema file for consistency.",
"Let me update the MySQL schema to include the paid column.",
"Let me create a test file to verify the new functionality.",
"Let me open the existing test file to add new test cases.",
"Let me add a new test case for the paid visits functionality.",

"Let me check the testing dependencies for the VisitDetails class.",
"Let me check if I need to update the VisitsServiceClient to handle the paid field.",
"Let me open the VisitsServiceClient to check if any updates are needed.",
"The VisitsServiceClient doesn't need any updates since it's just passing through the Visit data and the paid field will be automatically included in the JSON serialization/deserialization.\n\nLet me check if I need to update the VisitsController in the visits-service to handle the paid field.",
"Let me open the VisitResource to check if any updates are needed.",
"The VisitResource doesn't need any updates since it's already handling all Visit fields through the Visit entity.\n\nLet me create a test for the Visit class to ensure the paid field works correctly.",
"I need to create the directory structure first.",
"Now let me create the test file.",
"Let me add the test code.",
"Let me create a test for the VisitResource to ensure it correctly handles the paid field when creating and retrieving visits.",
"Let me open the existing VisitResourceTest file to add new test cases.",
"Let me add a new test case for the paid field.",
"Let me check if I need to update any database migration scripts to handle the new paid column.",
"Let me open the visits service data.sql file to update the sample data.",
"Let me update the sample data to include the paid status.",
"Let me also update the MySQL data.sql file for consistency.",
"Let me update the MySQL sample data to include the paid status.",
"Let me check if I need to update any UI components to display the paid status.",
"Let me search for any Angular templates that might need updating.",
"Let me check if there are any React components that need updating.",
"Let me check if there are any Vue components that need updating.",
"Let me check if there are any Thymeleaf templates that need updating.",
"Let me open the visits template to add the paid status display.",
